It is truly is a treasure of Australia - ridiculous in its randomness, exceptional in its beauty. And amongst an incredibly diverse melting pot of cultures from around the globe, it is also connected so closely to largely intact and diverse Indigenous populations and cultures. You unlearn everything up here - to relearn, learn and keep learning.<\/p><p>I really love this place. I admire the beauty of both the people and the places - it’s so diverse with so much colour and movement. There’s truly no place as wild or wonderful the world over, and I feel incredibly lucky to be leading the life I am right now.<\/p><p>I am a Creative Director, working in the arts and fashion, across a range of local and interstate projects. I spend lots of time in remote communities working with incredible artists and young people (some of the most beautiful and untouched places this country has) and really enjoy bringing this creative ingenuity and knowledge into the fold of lots of the work I do. I am really grateful to be leading the life I am right now.<\/p>"}},"e0446548-9a00-4cb9-8c0d-af015beb1b40":{"type":"image","settings":{"grid_x":6,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/1_6cf59e84-eaac-4934-9911-f3c31995f0a7.jpg","image_title":"","image_subtitle":"","popup_products":[]}}},"block_order":["21974921-41dc-4b80-a992-bcf1f47ca957","e0446548-9a00-4cb9-8c0d-af015beb1b40"],"settings":{"grid_gap_value":"0","grid_gap_value_vertical":"","horizontal_padding":"small","vertical_padding":"small","vertical_alignment":"center"}},"781c5d40-3a71-4a67-9bce-a33d353cd94b":{"type":"content-blocks","blocks":{"42fbbaa6-d96b-44cc-a3b8-faacf9800658":{"type":"image","settings":{"grid_x":12,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/12_4b1fea7d-4127-41fd-8ec5-b7071d5ae3b1.jpg","image_title":"","image_subtitle":"","popup_products":[]}},"00395eaf-9c5d-4684-b43b-04c5f757d2ec":{"type":"text","settings":{"grid_x":12,"text_title":"2.
