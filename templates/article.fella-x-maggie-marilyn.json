We wanted to fill a gap in the market that focused on high-quality fabrics, beautiful fits and refined shapes. <\/p><p>Another big focus was on wastage. For the first four years of Fella, we existed completely as a made-to-order company, until demand became so high that we had to transition to putting stock behind our best-selling styles and keeping the lower sellers as made-to-order only.
