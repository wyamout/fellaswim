But I’ve enjoyed cooking a variety of Mediterranean dishes, making me reminisce about the summers spent in Europe. The past year has been all about creating culinary escapes and table-scapes inspired by the Mediterranean. I’ve enjoyed making pasta (both Italian and Greek recipes), Greek baked fish, calamari in wine and managed to tackle cleaning and cooking with globe artichokes for the first time. I’ve also treated myself to meals from some of some of Australia’s most talented chefs such as lobster spanakopita by Josh Niland from Saint Peter, and a whole stuffed and roasted ‘Ethical Farmers’ free-range chicken with brussels sprouts, crisp spuds and gravy by Sean Moran.<\/p>"}},"image_KFNpVL":{"type":"image","settings":{"grid_x":12,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/6_b53a3836-19ae-4cb5-a1d8-21d31bfe837c.jpg","image_title":"","image_subtitle":"","popup_products":[]}}},"block_order":["text_hEfjxM","image_KFNpVL"],"settings":{"grid_gap_value":"","grid_gap_value_vertical":"","horizontal_padding":"small","vertical_padding":"small","vertical_alignment":"center"}},"content_blocks_dXAi6A":{"type":"content-blocks","blocks":{"image_jhChUT":{"type":"image","settings":{"grid_x":12,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/4_06808ad8-b24d-490a-b90c-a9731358e026.jpg","image_title":"","image_subtitle":"","popup_products":[]}},"text_PfNP9d":{"type":"text","settings":{"grid_x":12,"text_title":"6.

A quote by John Olsen resonated with me: When you ultimately leave this world, be remembered as someone who gave more than they took. Be remembered for your kindness and compassion. Use your ego to lift others, not to make other lives feel less. Let your authentic happiness be infectious, especially when people feel they can’t find it in themselves. We are all creative in some form. Learn to recognise the that the creative act is a process of self-discovery, not a competition. Make art for the enjoyment of it, not to prove something to others.Just make things without caring about what others might think.
