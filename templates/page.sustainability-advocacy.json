We are captivated by the powerful storytelling of these artists, and since 2020, we’ve made a lasting commitment to collaborate with a new artist each year.</p><p>Being a company that has benefitted from support, access and opportunity, we strive to lift up others so that they, too, can know the beauty of freedom, kindness and possibility. We are a brand for women by women and are deeply committed to the education, safety and empowerment of all females, a cause we support through various initiatives and partnerships with the likes of i=Change. $1 from every sale is donated by FELLA on behalf of our customers to one of the following charities apart of i=Change. Educate a Girl, Prevent Women Dying and Restore the Reef. </p><p>Through this initiative, we have provided education to girls at high risk of trafficking, empowering them to pursue their dreams and build lives of dignity and hope—breaking the cycle of poverty and exploitation. Additionally, our collective efforts support breast cancer research and help prevent harmful sediment from entering the waterways of the Great Barrier Reef. </p><p>Where there is surplus stock, we keep it circular, donating to a range of Australian charities, including RUAH and Thread Together. </p><p>Ruah is a not-for-profit community organisation dedicated to empowering individuals to effect meaningful change in their lives. They provide high-quality support services while working to transform ineffective systems. Via 20 diverse programs across Western Australia, their mission is to combat poverty and social disadvantage. </p><p>Founded in 2012, Thread Together aims to redirect new, unsold clothing from landfills to those in need. This vital organisation champions circularity within the fashion industry, offering an ethical solution to the problem of excess in fashion. Through their efforts, they promote sustainability while supporting individuals and communities in need.</p>",
