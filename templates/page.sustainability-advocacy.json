We are captivated by the powerful storytelling of these artists, and since 2020, we’ve made a lasting commitment to collaborate with a new artist each year.</p><p>We are a brand created by women, for women, dedicated to education, safety, and empowerment. Through our partnerships—like our collaboration with<strong> i=Change</strong>—we actively support meaningful initiatives. With every purchase, FELLA donates $1 on behalf of our customers to one of three impactful causes: <strong>Educate a Girl</strong>, <strong>Prevent Women Dying</strong>,<strong> </strong>and<strong> Restore the Reef</strong>.</p><p>Through this initiative, we’ve helped provide education to girls at high risk of trafficking, empowering them to pursue their dreams and build lives filled with dignity and<br/>hope — breaking the cycle of poverty and exploitation. Our collective efforts also contribute to breast cancer research and protect the Great Barrier Reef by preventing harmful sediment from entering its waterways.</p><p>Where there is surplus stock, we keep it circular, donating to a range of Australian<br/>charities, including <strong>RUAH</strong> and <strong>Thread Together</strong>. </p><p>Ruah is a not-for-profit community organisation dedicated to empowering individuals to effect meaningful change in their lives. They provide high-quality support services while working to transform ineffective systems. Via 20 diverse programs across Western Australia, their mission is to combat poverty and social disadvantage. </p><p>Founded in 2012, Thread Together aims to redirect new, unsold clothing from landfills to those in need. This vital organisation champions circularity within the fashion<br/>industry, offering an ethical solution to the problem of excess in fashion. Through their efforts, they promote sustainability while supporting individuals and communities in need.</p><p>Being a company that has benefitted from support, access and opportunity, we strive to lift up others so that they, too, can know the beauty of freedom, kindness and possibility. </p>",
